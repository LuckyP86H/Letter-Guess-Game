# Psychic Game (Basic)

**Instructions:**

1. The guest user pick up a letter for matching the one that computer generate. Here are some data log while playing:

  * You currently choose: (the letter that the user currently pressed)
    - Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
    
    - Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)

  * Guesses Left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
  
  * Your Guesses So Far: (the list of letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)

2. Note: 

  * When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page). 

  *  When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
